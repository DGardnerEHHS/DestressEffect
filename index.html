Pilates

		<div>Pilates </div>
		<div>Pilates can be incredibly powerful in providing a place for the body to relax, rejuvenate and release tension. It also provides a space for the mind to focus on the present moment, leaving worries at the door. The Pilates principle, breath, oxygenates the blood which triggers the brain to calm down. The breath creates a physiological response in the body that naturally decreases our stress and anxiety.</div>

</div>
		<div>“My hobbies are playing basketball and enjoying a relaxing night watching netflix. I am interested in doing research to create products that solve issues, and I can’t wait to see if the app works. It was difficult to come up with a tangible solution that hasn't been created yet, but in this Digital Skills 21 class I have learned how to use technology and how to organize my things. I have also learned how to think outside the box.”</div>
		<div>My hobby is playing soccer. I like to work on the computer and write emails. The gum idea was very impressive because everyone likes gum. My favorite part of the project was coming up witht he solution and working in the science lab.</div>
		<div>Sienna Demaio
</div>
		<div>My favorite hobbies are dancing and cheerleading. For this project, I am working with the web Graphics and Design Department I am very excited to see the final product of this, because we're all putting a lot of work into trying to complete this efficiently.</div>
		<div>My hobbies are general karate and soccer. Our closer look idea was hard to come up with because we did not have a main point. I took this class for writing emails and citing evidence.</div>
		<div>"I highly enjoy dancing. I am on the Social Media team for this project. I can not wait for our final product because we have been working so hard.</div>
		<div>My favorite thing to do is to play sports of all kind. I am working on the stress relief team. I want to see how the app comes out because we work hard on this project, so I want to see the final product.</div>
		<div>Anthony Venturo
</div>
		<div>“My hobbies are building and sports. I'm very active, and do sports to keep my busy. Also, I like to be creative. I am very hands on like to build because it relaxes me. I am very interested in learning how to be a better writer and thinker in this class. I have learned future skills in my Digital Skills 21 class such as learning to send a professional and well formulated email. I think it is good we have two different ideas and, are combining them which helped make our solution even bigger, better, and more effective. I can't wait to see if stress can be stopped with the olfactory senses.”</div>
		<div>Juiliana Constantanopile </div>
		<div>"I have a lot of interest with his class. I have learned a lot of things that can be helpful in everyday life and in Expo.

		<div>"My hobbies consist of playing soccer and basketball. Our closer look idea was hard to chose because we had many different ideas. I am excited to see what the outcome for our hard work."</div>
		<div>“I highly enjoy basketball, volleyball, and photography. I am in the Web Design and Graphics department for our project. Coming up with our idea wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. We combined many ideas together like Olfactory and an app to create a great product that I hope will be successful.”</div>

		<div>1. SOFTEN THE CORN SYRUP. First, stand the pouch of corn syrup in a cup and pour in enough boiling water so that the water level is about the same level as that of the corn syrup. It will flow out more quickly when it's hot.
2. PREPARE THE KNEADING SURFACE. Sprinkle about 1/2 of the confectioner's sugar onto the cutting board in a small mound.
 3. MELT THE GUM BASE. You can melt the gum base either in a microwave or in a pot on your stovetop. First, pour the gum base out of its plastic bag and into the disposable pan.
 4. MIX. Cut the end of the pouch and squeeze the corn syrup into the gum base. Stir up the mixture and empty it into the sugar on the cutting board.
 5. KNEAD. Knead (a rolling and folding motion) the mixture just like you would with bread dough. Then, divide the gum into two parts (or however many parts as you have flavors) on the table.
 6. ADD FLAVOR. Add each flavor to each part. Mix in the remaining sugar to each part. Keep pulling, tugging, and kneading each part.
 7. CUT. Roll it out pretty thin, just as you would pie dough. Make sure you coat your rolling tool with sugar so the gum will not stick. Cut the gum into whatever sized pieces you wish. Wrap the remaining gum in aluminum foil or wax paper so you can save some for later.
